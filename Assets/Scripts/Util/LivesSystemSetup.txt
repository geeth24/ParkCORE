========== LIVES SYSTEM SETUP INSTRUCTIONS ==========

1. GAME MANAGER SETUP:
   - In your **main starting scene** (e.g., Main Menu or the first level), create an empty GameObject.
   - Name it "GameManager".
   - Add the `GameManager` script to this GameObject.
   - Configure the following settings in the Inspector:
     - Max Lives: Set to 3 (or your preferred number).
     - Game Over Delay: Time in seconds before loading Game Over scene.
     - Game Over Scene Name: Name of your Game Over scene (leave empty to just restart current scene).
     - Lives UI Scene Name: Set this to "LivesScene".
   - Make sure this `GameManager` object persists across scenes (it uses `DontDestroyOnLoad`).

2. LIVES UI SCENE SETUP:
   - Create a new scene named "LivesScene" (or the name you put in `GameManager`).
   - In this "LivesScene", create your Canvas and UI elements for displaying lives (either Option A or B below).
   - Add the `LivesUI` script to the appropriate GameObject within the Canvas (e.g., the Horizontal Layout Group or the TextMeshPro object).
   - Configure the `LivesUI` script in the Inspector (assign Text or Images/Sprites).

   OPTION A - Icon-based Lives Display (in LivesScene):
   - Create a Canvas GameObject (UI > Canvas).
   - Add a Horizontal Layout Group (Right-click Canvas > UI > Horizontal Layout Group).
   - Name it "LivesDisplay".
   - Position it (e.g., top-left).
   - Add Image components as children.
   - Add `LivesUI` script to "LivesDisplay".
   - Assign Images and Sprites in the Inspector.
   - Ensure "Use Icons Mode" is checked.

   OPTION B - Text-based Lives Display (in LivesScene):
   - Create a Canvas GameObject (UI > Canvas).
   - Add a TextMeshPro - Text component (Right-click Canvas > UI > TextMeshPro - Text).
   - Name it "LivesText".
   - Position it.
   - Add `LivesUI` script to "LivesText".
   - Assign the TextMeshPro component in the Inspector.
   - Ensure "Use Icons Mode" is unchecked.

3. LEVEL SCENE (e.g., "Level 1 Lava") SETUP:
   - **Remove any existing Canvas or UI elements related to lives display from your level scenes.** The UI will now be loaded from "LivesScene".
   - Ensure your KillZones have respawn points assigned.

4. SCENE MANAGEMENT:
   - Add **both** your level scene(s) (e.g., "Level 1 Lava") AND the "LivesScene" to your Build Settings (File > Build Settings).
   - If using a "GameOver" scene, add that too.
   - Ensure your **starting scene** (the one with the persistent GameManager) is the first scene (index 0) in the Build Settings.

5. TESTING:
   - Start the game from your main starting scene.
   - Verify the lives UI from "LivesScene" loads correctly on top of your level.
   - Test falling into KillZones.
   - Verify game over works.
