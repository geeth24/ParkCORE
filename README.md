The game we created is a 3D third-person parkour game built using Unity. This game allows users to control a character by running, jumping, and climbing around and through vertical obstacles. The objective of the game is to make it through the level without dying. Your character dies by falling off the obstacles and touching the lava. Lava will be rising while the game is being played. If a player touches the lava, it pushes them back to the starting point, and it will also reset the lava and the player will lose a life. The user has 3 lives to complete the level, then they will be pushed to a game-over screen. Victory is achieved by reaching the goal area before running out of lives.
